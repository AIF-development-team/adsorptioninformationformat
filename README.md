# Adsorption Information File
This repository contains the details of an universal file format for gas adsorption experiments.

## Core dictionary
The current dictionary of data items used by adsorption information files can be found below:

| data name | description |
| --- | --- |
| _exptl_operator | name of the person who ran the experiment (string) |
| _exptl_instrument | date and time of the experiment (date-time string representation)|
| --- | --- |

## raw2aif converter
A simple program was produced for windows and mac computers to facilitate the production of adsorption information files from raw analysis text files exported by Quantachrome software and the raw data files (\textit{.DAT}) and CSV files exported by Belsorb software.

The current versions of these programs can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/jackevansadl/jubliant-waddle/releases),
of this repository.
