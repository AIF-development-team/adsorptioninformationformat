# Adsorption Information File
This repository contains the details of an universal file format for gas adsorption experiments.

## Core dictionary
The current dictionary of data items used by adsorption information files can be found below:

| data name | description |
| --- | --- |
| _exptl_operator | name of the person who ran the experiment (string) |
| _exptl_date | date of the experiment (string in ISO 8601 format)|
| _exptl_instrument | instrument id used for the experiment (string)    | 
| _exptl_adsorptive |  name of the adsorptive (string)    | 
| _exptl_temperature | temperature of the experiment (float)    | 
| _exptl_sample_mass | mass of the sample (float)   | 
| _sample_id | unique identifying code used by the operator (string)  | 
| _sample_material_id | designated name for the material (string)   | 
| _units_temperature | units of temperature (string)  | 
| _units_pressure | units of pressure (string)   | 
| _units_mass | units of mass (string)  | 
| _units_loading | units of amount adsorbed (string)   | 
| _adsorp_pressure | equilibrium pressure of the adsorption measurement (float)  | 
| _adsorp_p0 |  saturation pressure of the adsorption measurement at the temperature of the experiment(float)   | 
| _adsorp_loading  | amount adsorbed during the adsorption measurement (float)   | 
| _desorp_pressure | equilibrium  pressure of the desorption measurement at the temperature of the experiment (float)   | 
| _desorp_p0 | saturation pressure of the desorption measurement at the temperature of the experiment (float)   | 
| _desorp_loading |  amount adsorbed during the desorption measurement (float)   | 

## raw2aif converter
A simple program was produced for windows computers to facilitate the production of adsorption information files from raw analysis text files exported by Quantachrome software (*.txt*) and the Belsorb software raw data files (*.DAT*) and xls files exported by Micromeritics software (*.xls*).

The current versions of this program can be found on the [release page](https://github.com/jackevansadl/adsorptioninformationformat/releases/tag/v0.0.4),
of this repository.

The steps to using this program is straightforward. Once opened browse to the location of an adsorption raw file.

Then once you have located a raw data file and labelled a material ID press the *start* button to convert the data to AIF format.

The conversion is successful. From here you can restart the program to convert another file.

If there are any errors please contact the Jack Evans with the data file that was unable to be converted.
